CECS 326 - Project 2

For Project 2, we are given the problem regarding the implementation of philosophers where we must find a solution using either POSIX mutex locks and condition variables or Java condition variables:

In this case, my partner and I decided to go toward the Java condition variable route where we divided it up into 4 separate files: DiningPhilosopher, DiningServerImpl, DiningServer, Philosopher

For DiningPhilosophers.java:
    We created this file which essentially creates the DiningPhilosophers class to help create the layout in which the dining server and philosophers were interacting once the program began to compile.

For DiningServer.java:
    We created this file which essentially creates the DiningServer interface where we will call and utilize the philosopher class to help to determine whether they are wish to eat or are finished eating
